Aero 3D

Practice project for aerodynamics en graphics.

Also semi intended as testing ground for NUNA12 software ideas

=============================================

Meant to test a way of automatic instanced rendering.

It currently has:

	- very fancy buffer handler and draw call manager
	- Easy object orientation/position manipulation
	- window resizing
	- SMAA anti-aliasing
	- V-Sync
	
It is fully inline, because I like to keep my declarations and definitions nice and close :)

Plans are to try and simulate general fluid dynamics, with a focus on aerodynamics.
